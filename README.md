It looks like the cluster of 5 is more reasonable
Our customers can be seen as :
1. People who are earning less but spending more

2. People who are earning less and spending less

3. People who are earning more and spending less

4. People who are also earning more and spending more

5. People who earn on the average and are spending on the average as well
